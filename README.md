# SpaceCleanup
Game story: Captain Nova is a dedicated pilot who is on a mission to clear hazardous space garbage left behind by decades of failed and careless expeditions run by the government. She is the last pilot of 5, part of the Galactic Clean-Up Corps, and has had to continue on this dangerous journey alone. She’s been successful so far but the region she is currently scouring is highly unstable, filled with asteroids and abandoned wreckage bigger than she’s ever encountered before. The challenge is to survive, clean up the galaxy as best as she can, and hopefully make it back home all in one piece.

How to play the game: The player controls a space ship navigating through space. The goal of the game is to collect all space garbage whilst actively avoiding getting hit by bigger space debris and asteroids. The ship can only collect garbage of a smaller size than its own. Points are awarded for each valid item collected but lost when collided with damaging material. The player completes the game/ moves to the next level once all the garbage has been collected.

Key bindings: WASD/ Arrow keys - navigate the spaceship. Spacebar - shoot weapon. "E" - enable space shield.
