# SpaceCleanup
Player must control an aircraft and navigate it through space. The goal of the game is to collect all hazardous space garbage whilst actively avoiding getting hit by bigger space debris. The ship is only able to collect debris of a smaller size than its own. Points are lost when collided with damaging material. The game ends when space is cleared.
